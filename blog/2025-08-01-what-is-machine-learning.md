Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time **without being explicitly programmed**.

## 🔍 Why is ML Important?

- Helps make predictions or decisions based on past data
- Powers many applications: recommendation systems, chatbots, fraud detection, etc.

## 📚 Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**  
   Model is trained on labeled data (e.g., spam vs. not spam emails)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   Model finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation)

3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   Model learns through rewards and punishments (e.g., self-driving cars)

## 🧠 Real-World Applications

- Netflix recommendations
- Face recognition
- Virtual assistants (like Alexa, Siri)
- Medical diagnosis
- Stock market predictions
