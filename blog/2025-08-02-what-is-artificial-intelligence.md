## 🧠 Core Branches of AI

1. **Machine Learning (ML)**  
   Algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and improve over time.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   The ability of machines to understand and generate human language (like ChatGPT!).

3. **Computer Vision**  
   Teaching machines to see, identify, and process visual data like images and videos.

4. **Robotics**  
   Physical AI: Machines that perceive the world and act in it (self-driving cars, drones).

5. **Expert Systems**  
   AI systems trained with rules to mimic decision-making abilities of human experts.
